# Local-Weather-App
1.   Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV.
2.   Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3.   Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4.   User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
5.   User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
6.   User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
7.   We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
8.   Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.
9.   When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
10.   You can get feedback on your project from fellow campers by sharing it in our Code Review Chatroom. You can also share it on Twitter and your city's Campsite (on Facebook).
